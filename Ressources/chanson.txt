Hey Jude
Don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let him in to your heart
And can start to make it better
Hey Jude
Don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get him
The minute you let him under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
Anytime feel the pain
Hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world on your shoulder
Well, know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Hey Jude
Don't let me down
You have found him
Now go out and get him
Remember to let him in to your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Let him out
Let him in
Hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform
Don't you know it's just you
Hey Jude, too
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Hey Jude
Don't let me down
Take a sad, sad song and make it better
Remember, let him under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
